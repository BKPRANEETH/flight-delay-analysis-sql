# Flight Delay Analysis using SQL

This project focuses on analyzing flight delay and cancellation trends using a large dataset from 2019 to 2023. The goal is to understand patterns across airlines, airports, and seasons to identify which factors most contribute to delays.

## 🎯 Objective

- Examine delay frequencies across U.S. airlines and airports.
- Identify seasonal or time-based delay trends.
- Determine the most common causes of delays.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `/SQL`: SQL scripts used for exploration and analysis.
- `/Data`: Instructions and links to download the dataset.

## 📄 Dataset

- Source: [Flight Delay and Cancellation Dataset (2019-2023) on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023)
- Size: ~100MB
- Format: CSV files with date, airline, airport, and delay info.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Download the dataset and load it into your SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
2. Run queries from `/SQL/flight_delay_analysis.sql`.
3. Analyze patterns such as average delays, cancellations by airline, and delay causes.

## 🔍 Key Queries

- Airlines with the highest average delays
- Most delayed routes
- Common reasons for delay (e.g., weather, carrier issues)
- Seasonal trends in flight delays

## 🛠 Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Kaggle dataset
